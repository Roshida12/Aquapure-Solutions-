        <h1>Clean Water</h1>
        <p>
            Clean water is water that is free from harmful pollutants, impurities, and contaminants. Found in rivers, lakes, underground reservoirs, and rainwater, it is an essential natural resource used for countless purposes, including agriculture, energy production, and daily human activities. Its purity allows it to serve as a foundation for innovation and growth, supporting both natural ecosystems and societal development.

            Only 3% of Earth’s water is freshwater, and less than 1% is easily accessible for human use. This limited supply makes clean water an incredibly valuable and vulnerable resource. Factors like pollution, over-extraction, and climate change further threaten its availability, underscoring the importance of careful management and protection. Clean water is not just abundant—it is finite and needs to be safeguarded.

Even today, access to clean water is critical for modern infrastructure and technological advancements, powering energy systems and industries worldwide. Societies have always evolved around their ability to utilize and protect this vital resource.
